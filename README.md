# RSA
Simple implementation of the RSA algorithm written in Python. The aim of this project is to show how sensitive data can be encrypted and decrypted securely using various concepts of discrete mathematics applied to computer science.<br />Learn more about discrete mathematics here: <https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:OCW+6.042J+2T2019/about>

## Basics of number theory and probability
### The modulo operation
The modulo is an arithmetic operation that computes the remainder of the euclidean division. Here are the most important cases:
1. 0 mod any integer other than 0 gives back 0.
2. a mod n where a is strictly inferior than n gives back a.
3. a mod n where a is greater than or equal to n gives back the remainder of the euclidean division: rem = a - k times n, with max(k) s. t. k times n is inferior than or equal to n.
